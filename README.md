## _Precautions and warnings before travelling_
Like every other holiday destination, precautions have to be taken into account when visiting somewhere new. Better to be safe than sorry.

### _Safety_

- Bushfires occur in the summertime, so monitor the news and local media if you're travelling at that time
- Drink spiking is common; so do not leave your drink unattended
- Bag snatching, pickpocketing occur on beaches, public transport and tourist hot-spots. Do not leave your belongings unattended.

### _Local Laws_
- Always carry photo identification or ID                                                                       
- Gambling is only legal in licensed venues
- Possession or use of illegal drugs will attract large fines
- If you are a victim of crime, or have gotten yourself in some sort of unwanted trouble, contact [APAV](http://apav.pt/mihy/index.php/welcome)

### _Health_
- Medical treatment is expensive (no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Portugal and Australia)
- May need an import permit to get medication by post

## _Local Contacts_
When in trouble, the _Consular Services Charter_ details what the Australian Government can assist you with overseas. If you are seeking consular assistance, you should visit or contact the Australian Embassy in Lisbon.
